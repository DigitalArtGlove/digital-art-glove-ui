# digital-art-glove-ui
IGEN 430 Project to create digital art using inputs from a glove with force and flex sensors, an IMU, and computer vision.

To run this project please `cd` into the `digital-art-glove-ui` folder and run the `npm run dev` command. Make sure to run this after you have already run the computer vision side of the project. Otherwise, this UI will not receive any input position data and therefore won't draw any lines.
